### :wave: Hello!

:star: I am Kristen Gallagher, a senior at Communications High School in Wall, New Jersey. I am interested in majoring in Computer Science. This is a portfolio of my recent coding projects!  
:bulb: I have an advanced knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and PHP. <br /> 
:iphone::heavy_plus_sign::trophy: I am currently taking Advanced Java Programming, where I created and built an app in Android Studio that initiates an easy, sustainable way to donate children's outgrown clothing, books, and toys to local families while reducing landfills, supporting low-income families, and building a network of parents. This app won first place in the 2022 NJ-4 Congressional App Challenge. Here's a video explaining the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSX36zY8Tk<br /> 
:computer: In my Advanced Web Design course, I redesigned my town's website and created an informational website. Currently, I am designing and coding new pages for my school district's website.<br />
